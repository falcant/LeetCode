"""
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.


Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

      A few things used here:
      - Slicing (to avoid for loops)
      - instead of checking nums[i] + nums[i+1] = target
        we check if target - nums[i] = numer[i+1], where i corresponds to each element
        in the nums list.
